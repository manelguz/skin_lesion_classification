# skin_lesion_classifier

Skin lesion classifier is my approach to problem presented in Deep Learning Udacity Course. It tries to classify skin lesion images into three different classes: 

- Melanoma

- Nevus

- Seborrheic Keratosis


It has been build in python3.6 under the PyTorch framework. 

For the proposed approach, based on Transfer Learning, I have chosen the VGG16 pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset (provided by PyTorch) 


Data Sets 
--------

It has been used ISIC2017 dataset for trainning and testing


Install
--------

It is suggested to use virtualenv (https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html)

Then use pip to install the requirement:

```
pip install -r requirement.txt
```
